## My Library: Slideshow
My name: Mayur Khatri

I used the slideshow library to make a slideshow which showcases some of the features of the slideshow library, it is powerful because it has built in functions to switch slides, change colors and fonts, and add pictures. You can also start using the library with very little experience because of good, simple syntax.

Here is a piece of code which makes three slides, and shows how to add bullets with item and keys to switch slides.


* a narrative of what you did
* highlights of code that you wrote, with explanation
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* at least one diagram or figure showing your work

The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. 

You need at least one image (output, diagrams). Images must be uploaded to your repository, and then displayed with markdown in this file; like this:

![test image](/testimage.png?raw=true "test image")
